        <p className="simple_answers">
          Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. It helps
          you write applications that behave consistently, run in different
          environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. On
          top of that, it provides a great developer experience, such as live
          code editing combined with a time traveling debugger.
