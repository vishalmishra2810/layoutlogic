          The inline way of applying CSS to an HTML document is by using the
          style attribute in the HTML element. The internal way of applying CSS
          to an HTML document is by using the style element in the head section
          of the HTML document. The external way of applying CSS to an HTML
          document is by using the link element in the head section of the HTML
          document.
