        <p className="simple_answers">
          Sass is a CSS preprocessor that allows you to use variables, nested
          rules, mixins, inline imports, and more. SassScript is the scripting
          language itself. SCSS is a superset of CSS that adds nesting,
          variables, mixins, and other features that make writing CSS easier.
          SCSS files use the extension .scss.
