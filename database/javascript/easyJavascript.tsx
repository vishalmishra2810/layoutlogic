    question: "What is JavaScript?",
    answer: (
      <>
        <p className="simple_answers">
          JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled
          programming language with first-class functions. While it is most
          well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser
          environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe
          Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm,
          single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented,
          imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.

    question: "What is a variable in JavaScript, and how do you declare one?",
    answer: (
      <>
        <p className="simple_answers">
          A variable is a container for a value, which can be a number, a
          string, a boolean, an array, an object, or even another function.
          Variables are declared using the var keyword. You can also declare a
          variable using the let keyword, which is the preferred way to declare
          variables in modern JavaScript.

    question: "What is a function in JavaScript, and how do you declare one?",
    answer: (
      <>
        <p className="simple_answers">
          A function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. A
          JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls
          it). You can declare a function using the function keyword. You can
          also declare a function using the arrow function syntax.

    question: "What is an array in JavaScript, and how do you create one?",
    answer: (
      <>
        <p className="simple_answers">
          An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value at
          a time. You can create an array using the array literal syntax or the
          Array constructor.

    question: "What is an if statement in JavaScript, and how do you use one?",
    answer: (
      <>
        <p className="simple_answers">
          An if statement is used to execute a block of code if a specified
          condition is true. You can use an if statement to execute a block of
          code if a condition is true, or to execute a different block of code
          if that condition is false.

    question: "What is a loop in JavaScript, and how do you use one?",
    answer: (
      <>
        <p className="simple_answers">
          A loop is a programming structure that repeats a sequence of
          instructions until a specific condition is met. You can use a loop to
          execute a block of code a number of times.

    question:
      "What is a switch statement in JavaScript, and how do you use one?",
    answer: (
      <>
        <p className="simple_answers">
          A switch statement is used to perform different actions based on
          different conditions. You can use a switch statement to select one of
          many code blocks to be executed.

    question:
      "What is a break statement in JavaScript, and how do you use one?",
    answer: (

        <p className="simple_answers">
          A break statement is used to terminate a switch or a loop. You can use
          a break statement to terminate a switch or a loop.

          A continue statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop.
